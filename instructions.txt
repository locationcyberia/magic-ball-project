Steps to complete this assignment:

1. In the first line of "index.js" write 'console.log("Welcome to this magic eight ball application");'
2. Create a constant variable called first name and set it as your first name: 'const first_name = "your name goes here";'
3. Create a constant variable called last name and set it as your last name: 'const last_name = "your name goes here";'
4. Create a variable using let called question and set it to a question: 'let question = "your question goes here";'
5. Write a console.log statement that says "Hello my name is {first name} {last name} and my question is: {question}", ex: 'console.log("Hello my name is " + first_name + " " + last_name + " and my question is " + question);'
6. Under the last_name variable and create a constant full name variable, use template literals to concatenate the first and last name variables, ex: 'const fullName = `${first_name} ${last_name}`;'
7. Change the code in the last console.log statement to use template literals instead of string concatentation. ex: 'console.log(`Hello my name is ${first_name} ${last_name} and my question is: ${question});'
8. In the final console.log use the fullName variable instead of the first and last name variables: ex: 'console.log(`Hello my name is ${fullName}....`);'
9. In the final console.log use the .toUpperCase() method on question, ex: 'console.log(`... ${question.toUpperCase()`});'
10. In the final console.log use "\n" to create a new line after "my question is:", ex: 'console.log(`... my question is:\n...`);'
11. After the last console.log statement, create a constant variable called random number, use the Math.random and Math.round functions to return a number between 1 and 8 and set the result to this variable, HINT at the number 1 at the end of the equation.
12. Create a new console.log statement and write the following code: 'console.log(`The answer to your question is ${random_number === 1 ? 'Yes' : 'No'});'
**Bonus**: Check if random number is even, if it is even then print 'Yes', if the number is odd then print 'No'
13. Create a function called app, this function will be blank for right now, and will be a container for the rest of our application.
14. Create a function called greeting, in this function move the code from lines 1-6 into this function.
15. In the greeting function pass three arguments, first_name, last_name, and question respectively. Then inside this function remove the lines that declare the variables first_name, last_name, and question
16. Create a function called get_random_number, in this function move the variable random_number inside this function and return the value at the end of the function
17. In app call the greeting function, pass your first name, last name, and question respectively.
18. In app create a constant random_number variable and set it to get_random_number()
19. Move 'console.log(`The answer to your question is: ${random_number === 1 ? 'Yes' : 'No'}`);' inside the app function
20. Call the app function at the end of the code file
21. Create a function called magic_eight_ball, this function needs to take a parameter called number_result.
22. In the magic_eight_ball function use a switch case on the number_result parameter to handle the cases between 1-8, in each case console.log a different message, the default case should console.log the message "Not a valid case please use a number between 1 and 8"
23. Inside the app function call the magic_eight_ball function and pass the random_number variable as the argument. Make sure to remove the console.log that is inside the app function
